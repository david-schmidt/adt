                        --- 2.  INTRODUCTION ---

Apple II <==> Windows 32-bit

Apple Disk Transfer (ADT for short) is a set of two programs to
transfer standard 16-sector Apple II disks to and from 140k files
on a Windows computer.  The file format is compatible with many
Apple II emulators.

ADT 1.31 requires the Apple II to have either a Super Serial Card 
(or compatible), or an Apple Communications Card (or compatible),
or and IIgs.  Note that the IIc+ and //c include SSC-compatible
serial ports.

=========================================================================
                        --- 3.  INSTALLATION ---

----------------------------
]  3.1  HARDWARE

You will need a null-modem cable to connect the PC and the Apple II.
If you don't have one, you can make your own (see section 5.4 "Serial
Cable Wiring") or buy one at your local computer store.

    SSC: If you have a genuine Apple Super Serial Card, you can use
    a "straight-through" cable instead of a null-modem cable.  Simply
    set the jumper on the card to "terminal" rather than "modem".
    Thanks to Greg Bennett for this tip.
    (If you use your SSC for a printer, chances are it will already
    be set up this way.)

----------------------------
]  3.2  SOFTWARE, PC SIDE

Unzip the distribution .zip file into a folder of your choice.  
The executable file is ADT.EXE.

Windows Explorer method:
    Create a shortcut to ADT.EXE and move it to the directory where
    you want your .DSK files.  (Or right-drag ADT.EXE to that
    directory, and choose "Create Shortcut Here").  Double-click that
    shortcut.

Command Prompt method:
    Copy ADT.EXE into a directory in your PATH, or add the ADT folder
    to your PATH.  Change to the directory where you want your .DSK files
    with the 'cd' command, then type 'ADT' or 'start ADT'.

If you experience errors regarding missing DLL files, please see
section 5.1 "MSVCRT40.DLL".

----------------------------
]  3.3  SOFTWARE, APPLE SIDE


Boot any DOS 3.3 disk (or compatible, such as David-DOS) that will leave you
with the familiar Applesoft ']' prompt.  Make sure your disk has at least 16
free blocks, or insert one that does.  Type IN#x, where x is the
slot your serial card is in (typically, x=2). Set the speed to 300 baud.

    SSC: Set the speed by typing the characters "<ctrl-A>6B".
    If your SSC card is in "terminal" mode, use <ctrl-I> instead
    of <ctrl-A>.  (If you use your SSC for a printer, chances are
    it will be in "terminal" mode.)
    
    IIgs: Set the speed by typing the characters "<ctrl-A>6B".

Then, on the PC, start a comm program, set it for 300 baud N81 (no parity,
8-bit data, 1 stop bit), and ASCII-upload (not Xmodem or any other protocol
but a straight text upload) the appropriate dump file to the Apple.
(Example: Using HyperTerm Under Windows 95, you would Send Text.)
    adtpc.dmp   <-- Super Serial Card
    adt_cc.dmp  <-- Apple Communications Card

Alternately, from a Command Prompt enter these two commands:
    mode com1: baud=300 data=8 parity=n
    type adtpc.dmp > com1:
Substitute "com2" for "com1" and "adt_cc.dmp" for "adtpc.dmp" as necessary.

    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:  Thanks to "Delfs" for this tip.  Delfs tested this
    procedure on an AT class PC with MSDOS6 and Win9x, with both Apple //e
    and IIgs.  Information obtained from the official comp.sys.apple2
    (Csa2) FAQ "Telecom-1 Hardware & Transfers", at tne end of question 003.
    Copies available at Rubywand's excellent web site:
        http://home.swbell.net/rubywand/Csa2T1TCOM.html

During the transfer process, the program will enter itself into the
Monitor and save itself to disk under the name "ADT.SS" or "ADT.CC",
depending on which dump file you chose. Here are some tips to get this
to work. If nothing seems to work, you can always type in the hex dump
by hand (yep, it's getting longer with each new version, but it's
still under 2.5k).

     1. If you get a beep at every line, the PC comm program is
        probably sending CRLFs to your Apple, which only likes
        CRs. Turn on the "Strip linefeeds on output" option in
        your comm program.

     2. If you see total garbage on the Apple II screen, first be
        sure that the SSC and the comm program agree on the
        transfer speed. If they do, your comm program is probably
        doing something funny with the high bit (aka bit 7) of
        each character. Turn off the "Strip high bit on output"
        option.

     3. If you are uploading ADT to an unaccelerated Apple II,
        you may need to slow down the transfer. Your comm program
        probably allows you to set a fixed delay between each
        line (aka "line pacing"). A 1.2-second pause worked well
        with a 1 MHz Apple //c. [Note: disk transfers with ADT
        are done at 19200 bps, even with a 1 MHz machine. The
        slowness here is due to the way the Apple Monitor works.]

=========================================================================
                            --- 4.  USAGE ---

Run the PC-side program first.  It acts as a server for the Apple-side
program.

Except for the PC configuration (serial port & speed), ADT operation
is entirely controlled from the Apple II keyboard, so you can transfer
many disks without having to go back and forth between the two
computers.

----------------------------
]  4.1  PC-SIDE

Choose a serial port (1=COM1, 2=COM2, ...) and speed (19200 recommended)
then click "Connect".  Serial ports can only be used by one application
at a time; if your chosen port is already in use you will be notified,
and you should close whichever other application is using it.

It's OK to change port and speed while the connection is open, but not
while a transfer is in progress.

You may click "Disconnect" to relinquish the port to another app if
you wish, then click "Connect" to reclaim it.

Press ESC or click the "Reset" button at any time to abort the current
operation and return ADT to the "Ready" state.  See also "ABORTING" in
section 4.4 "Notes".

The serial port and speed may be specified as arguments when launching ADT.
This can save you time if the defaults are not correct for your system.
For example, to use port 2 at 9600 baud,
    Command Prompt method:  type "ADT 2 9600"
    Windows Explorer method:  view the Properties of your Windows
        Shortcut, select the "Shortcut" pane, and change the "Target"
        field to:  "C:\ADT\Adt.exe" 2 9600

----------------------------
]  4.2  APPLE-SIDE

From a DOS 3.3 prompt, type the appropriate command:
    BRUN ADT

At the top of the Apple screen, you will see your current configuration
info, which can be changed with the "Configure" command.

    SSC:Sn,nnnnn        Serial card slot and comm speed
    DISK:Sn,Dn          Disk drive slot and drive number

At the bottom of the Apple screen, you will see the following menu:

    Send, Receive, Dir, Configure, Quit?

To select an item, simply type the first letter of the word. One
keystroke is enough, you don't have to hit Return.


----------------------------
]  4.3  COMMANDS


--> SEND

ADT will ask for a PC-side filename.  It is recommended to end the
filename with ".DSK" or ".dsk".  Lowercase letters are OK, if your
Apple supports them.  Filenames up to 254 characters in length are
accepted.

ADT then reads the disk in the specified slot and drive and transmits
it to the PC, which will store it in that file. ADT will not overwrite
an existing file.  All files are stored in the current directory and
are 143,360 bytes in length.  (See section 5.2 "File Format" for a
description of its contents.)


--> RECEIVE

ADT will ask for a PC-side filename.  Lowercase letters are OK, if
your Apple supports them, but case will likely be ignored by the PC.
Filenames up to 254 characters in length are accepted.

ADT will then receive that file from the PC's current directory and
write it to the disk in the specified slot and drive, overwriting any
data that may be on the disk.  THE DISK MUST ALREADY BE 16-SECTOR
FORMATTED.  (You can use the Dos 3.3 "INIT" command to format a blank
disk.)  Before transmission, ADT ensures that the file exists and
is 143,360 bytes in length.


--> DIR

ADT will display a list of the files in the current Windows directory.
There is currently no way to change directories from within ADT.


--> CONFIGURE

This takes you to the ADT configuration menu. Use the up and down
arrow keys to select a parameter (Apple ][+ users, use space
instead). The left and right arrow keys change the value of the
current parameter. Return saves the displayed values and exits. Escape
exits without saving the changes.  Ctrl-D resets all parameters to the
default values (you can change the default values by using the BASIC
program ADT CONFIGURATION).

Here's an explanation of each parameter:

    Disk slot, disk drive, Comms device: self-explanatory. The
    defaults are slot 6, drive 1, and a Super Serial Card in slot 2.
    Rotate through the options to get to the IIgs modem if you are
    connecting via an IIgs.

    Comms speed: use the highest speed that works. The default is
    19200, and it works with my 1 MHz Apple //e.

    Read retries: number of times RWTS will try to read a sector
    before giving up. I suggest 1 or 2. If you have a
    particularly weak disk, and don't mind the recalibrating
    noise, you can increase it (also consider adjusting your
    drive speed, and cleaning the drive head).

    Write retries: same, but for writing to a disk. The default
    is 0: if I have trouble writing to a disk, even only once, I
    usually trash the disk. My data is worth more than $0.50.

    Use checksums: DOS puts a checksum at the end of each sector
    as an error-detection measure. If the checksum is wrong, it
    means the data is probably corrupt and RWTS will issue an I/O
    error. Setting this parameter to NO will defeat this check:
    even if the checksum is wrong, the sector will be read
    normally. This may be of some help in transferring very old
    disks on which a few bits have rotted. It will also allow ADT to
    copy disks where the only protection scheme is a different
    checksum algorithm.

        When you modify this parameter, ADT patches the copy of
    DOS in memory. If you're using a non-standard version of DOS,
    the code that checks for checksum errors may have been moved
    to a different address. In that case, ADT will show the words
    "DO NOT CHANGE" next to the parameter. (It will not prevent
    you from changing it, however... If you really want to
    overwrite two random bytes in your custom DOS, go ahead, but
    you assume all the risks!)

        This parameter was suggested by Andy McFadden.

    Enable sounds: YES means ADT will beep when a transfer is
    finished, and on some other occasions. If this parameter is
    set to NO, ADT will be totally silent. By the way, some of
    you old-timers may recognize the beep: it's the same beep
    used in my all-time favorite word processor, Apple Writer II
    by Paul Lutus.

    Save config: set to YES and hit enter to BSAVE the running
    copy of ADT back out to disk.

--> QUIT

This quits ADT, returning to DOS 3.3.


--> ?

Shows "About ADT" message.


----------------------------
]  4.4  NOTES

Even though ADT runs under DOS 3.3, it will also transfer ProDOS disks
as well as Pascal disks, because they are all in 16-sector format.

ADT will not transfer Apple files singly; it is used solely for entire
Apple disk images.

ADT will not transfer DOS 3.2 (13-sector) disks to PC; and, it will not
transfer protected disks to PC unless the protection scheme is based on
the DOS checksums only (and even then, there's no guarantee the disk will
work in an emulator).

ADT will not correctly transfer ProDOS-order (.po) disk image files to
the Apple II.  ADTPro (http://adtpro.sourceforge.net) will.

Meaning of characters on the Apple II status display:
    R: Reading from disk
    W: Writing to disk
    I: Receiving data from PC ("Input")
    O: Sending data to PC ("Output")
    .: Sector read or written correctly
    *: Error while reading or writing sector

ABORTING: You can press the escape key at any time during the transfer
and everything will stop. You will be back to the ADT menu. This is
true for the Apple and the PC. When you are aborting a transfer, stop
the _sending_ computer first. If you first stop the receiving
computer, it will continue to receive unexpected data and may become
confused.

                     --- 5.  TECHNICAL REFERENCE ---

----------------------------
]  5.1  MSVCRT40.DLL

The files MFC40.DLL and MSVCRT40.DLL are required for the Win32
Edition of ADT.  These files are bundled with Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 98, and later versions.

Windows 95 owners might see error messages mentioning these files,
if they haven't been installed by any of the myriad other applications
that also require them.  Technically, you should obtain them from
me, and though I can supply them by email I would greatly appreciate
it if you'd look for them on the web first.  There are plenty of sources,
though legally I can't recommend any specific one.  Try searching Google:
   http://www.google.com/search?query=mfc40.dll%20msvcrt40.dll%20download

Once obtained, copy both files into your C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM folder.
It should not be necessary to restart Windows.


----------------------------
]  5.2  FILE FORMAT

The .DSK file format was established for the apl2em emulator by
Randy Spurlock.  Bytes are sequenced in the naive way, making
indexing very simple in hexadecimal: byte number 0x000ttsbb
stores Byte 'bb' of Sector 's' of Track 'tt', like so:

   Byte #    Contents
   -------------------------------------
   0x00000   Track 00, Sector 0, Byte 00
      :
   0x000FF   Track 00, Sector 0, Byte FF

   0x00100   Track 00, Sector 1, Byte 00
      :
   0x00FFF   Track 00, Sector F, Byte FF

   0x01000   Track 01, Sector 0, Byte 00
      :
   0x22FFF   Track 22, Sector F, Byte FF

.DSK files are exactly 143,360 bytes long (0x23000).  No signature
bytes have been added by ADT, for compatibility's sake.

The ordering of sectors is according to the DOS 3.3 RWTS routine,
rather than the physical layout on the disk media.  ProDos maps
the physical layout to an alternate sequencing scheme, which is
not supported by this version of ADT.


----------------------------
]  5.3  SSC CONFIGURATION

The Super Serial Card has one jumper marked "TERMINAL/MODEM" and two DIP
switch banks, SW1 and SW2, with seven switches each. For typical ADT usage,
you may set them as follows, for 19200 baud 8N1:

  SW1-1 off      SW2-1 on
    1-2 off        2-2 on
    1-3 off        2-3 off
    1-4 off        2-4 on
    1-5 on         2-5 off
    1-6 on         2-6 off
    1-7 on         2-7 off

Put the TERMINAL/MODEM jumper pointing up at 'MODEM' if you plan to use a
null-modem cable. Set it to 'TERMINAL' to use a straight-through cable.

SW2-6 Interrupt is a hard switch, disabling interrupt from the SSC to the
CPU. ADT doesn't use interrupt so the suggested setting is 'off'. Some
other comm programs using the SSC need interrupt so SW2-6 should then be
on and actually this setting doesn't affect ADT so it is perfectly ok to
have it on too. So the setting of SW2-6 is don't care but if you use no
other comm program set it to off.

----------------------------
]  5.4  SERIAL CABLE WIRING


The Apple Super Serial Card has a Dsub-25 female connector.  The pins
are numbered as follows, when viewed from the outside:

 ,----------------------------------------. 
 \ 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 / 
  \  25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 / 
   `------------------------------------' 

The assigments are:

         1 Frame Ground 
         2 TXD: Transmit Data
         3 RXD: Receive Data
         4 RTS: Request To Send
         5 CTS: Clear To Send
         6 DSR: Data Set Ready
         7 GND: Signal Ground
         8 DCD: Data Carrier Detect
        19 CTS2: Alternate Clear To Send  (selected with DIP SW2-7)
        20 DTR: Data Terminal Ready


The PC connections are the same for a 25-pin connector.  Note that a
male connector has the numbering mirrored left-to-right.  If you instead
have a 9-pin connector, the numbering and assignments are (again, when
viewing a female connector face-on):

         ,----------------. 
         \ 05 04 03 02 01 / 
          \  09 08 07 06 / 
           `------------' 

         1 DCD: Data Carrier Detect
         2 RXD: Receive Data
         3 TXD: Transmit Data
         4 DTR: Data Terminal Ready
         5 GND: Signal Ground
         6 DSR: Data Set Ready
         7 RTS: Request To Send
         8 CTS: Clear To Send
         9 RI:  Ring Indicator

If your SSC is configured as a terminal, simply make sure your pin
assignments match.

Otherwise, make a NULL-MODEM cable by connecting the following:
        2 RXD <---- TXD 2 
        3 TXD ----> RXD 3
        4 DTR --+-> DSR 6
                \-> DCD 8
        5 GND ----- GND 7
        1 DCD <-+-- DTR 20
        6 DSR <-/
        7 RTS ----> CTS 5
        8 CTS <---- RTS 4

]  5.5  HISTORY

Rich Williamson (glitch@eskimo.com) released SENDDISK on April 9, 1993.
His Apple-side program read an entire disk with DOS' RWTS (Read Write
Track Sector) routine, and transmitted the data through an Apple
Super Serial Card in slot 1.  His PC-side program listened to COM1
for such a data stream, and stored it in a .DSK file, in the format
expected by the Apple II emulator "apl2em".

Paul Guerton (pg@sff.net) released Apple Disk Transfer (ADT) on
December 4th, 1995, and updated it July 14, 1999.  Starting with
SENDDISK, Paul added a nice screen layout, configuration menus,
error recovery, data stream compression, and the capability to
receive .DSK images from the PC and write them back to an
Apple II floppy disk.

Paul Schlyter (pausch@saaf.se) released ADTcc on June 13, 2000.
He modified ADT's Apple-side program to work with the older
Apple Communications Card and compatibles.

Sean Gugler (gugler-sean@cs.yale.edu) released ADT Win32 Edition on
December 1, 2000.  He replaced the older PC-side DOS program with
a Windows 32-bit API program of otherwise identical functionality.
This brings ADT into the world of background multi-tasking, long
file names, and support for Windows NT and its progeny.

David Schmidt (david__schmidt@users.sourceforge.net) backported
some enhancements from the ADTPro project back to ADT: converged
IIgs and SSC support, imbedded configuration saving, slot scanning
for automatic slot selection.  Release 1.31 came out December 27,
2006.
